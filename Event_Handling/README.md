Event Handling

As the name implies, these small bits of code are demonstrating objects' ability to
respond to user inputs in the form of things like key presses or mouse clicks (events).
As you begin to expand your capabilities as a developer, you encounter programs that
interact with other programs through events and may write some of your own. Enjoy!
