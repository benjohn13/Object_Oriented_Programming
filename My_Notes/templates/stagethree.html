        In this section, we covered what functions are, and how we can use them. Remember, a function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to
        perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
      </p>

        As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions 
        are called <em>user-defined</em> functions. For example, here is a function that takes a string as an input parameter and prints it on standard screen:
        <br>
        <pre>
        <code>
         def print me(str):<br>
         "This prints a passed string into this function"<br>
         print str<br>
         return<br>
        </code>
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we covered how to define a function, we talked about calling a function. Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters
        that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code. Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute 
        it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt.

        In this lesson, Kunal used the example of a blueprint to define a <em>Class</em> in Python. A <em>Class</em> is something we can use to create 
        <em>Instances</em> or <em>Objects</em>. So we could use a blueprint of a building, that has many of the basic layouts, and use it to make a 
        building that has colors, decorations and things we want. I've listed some terms and definitions below that I hear a lot on Udacity, which can be 
        found on many Python tutorial sites through Google. I recommend getting to know them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Class:</b> A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes
        are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.</li>
        <li><b>Class variable:</b> A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the
        class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.</li>
        <li><b>Instance variable:</b> A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.</li>
        <li><b>Inheritance:</b> The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.</li>
        <li><b>Instance:</b> An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</li>
        <li><b>Method:</b> A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</li>
        <li><b>Object:</b> A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</li>
      </ul>

        After going through this course, I took what I learned and created a website to host my 6 favorite movies/ shows. It includes trailers and movie posters. 
        If you would like to see it, simply click on this <a href="https://udacity-github-sync-content.s3.amazonaws.com/_submissions/48048_znyu8.zip">link</a> 
        to get the file, and open in in Python. Remeber to use the <em>f5</em> command to run it.
