Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model based on the concept 
of "objects". These objects may contain data in the form of fields, often known 
as attributes. And code in the form of procedures often known as "methods". One
of the features of objects is that its procedures can access and modify the data
fields of the object with which they are associated ("this" or "self"). In OOP, 
computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with 
one another. There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular 
ones are class-based. This means that objects are instances of classes, which 
also determines their type.

In short, OOP encourages the re-use of good code, separation of code and code 
legibility. Keep things simple by writing it once in such a way that it can be 
used with varying data and avoid making mistakes with typos or reducing the amount 
of work it takes to update/maintain your code. 

Rather than try to explain OOP further, I'd recommend taking this free course from 
Udacity, "Programming Foundations with Python" taught by Kunal Chawla. I have taken 
several courses in Python programming and had many mentors explain OOP. But I have 
always returned to Kunal's course for reference because he does an excellent job 
of explaining it from a basic perspective, while giving you a practical project
to build that helps you understand it better.

Here is my code from this project and I hope you have a chance to take the course
as well. It was a lot of fun and is great to show off to your friend and family.
