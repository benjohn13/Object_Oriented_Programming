Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model based on the concept 
of "objects". These objects may contain data in the form of fields, often known 
as attributes. And code in the form of procedures often known as "methods". One
of the features of objects is that its procedures can access and modify the data
fields of the object with which they are associated ("this" or "self"). In OOP, 
computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with 
one another. There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular 
ones are class-based. This means that objects are instances of classes, which 
also determines their type.

In short, OOP encourages the re-use of good code, separation of code and code 
legibility. Keep things simple by writing it once in such a way that it can be re-used 
with varying data over and over again, while reducing the amount of time it takes to 
update/maintain your code. 

I'd recommend taking this free course from Udacity, "Programming Foundations with 
Python" taught by Kunal Chawla. I have taken several courses in Python programming 
and had many mentors explain OOP. But Kunal's course does an excellent job of 
explaining it from a basic perspective, while giving you a practical project to build 
that helps you understand it better.

I hope you have a chance to take the course; it was a lot of fun and is great project
to build knowledge on. I also hope these examples of OOP help you understand it better
and that you enjoy learning the power of OOP.
